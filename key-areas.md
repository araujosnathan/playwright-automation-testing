# Key Areas
## 1. Deposits & Withdrawals (Payment Systems)

Affects revenue and trust. Any error in financial processing has a direct impact on the business. This functionality is constantly in use because, for games to be possible, users must deposit funds, and they need confidence that they can withdraw their winnings at any time.
Additionally, having multiple deposit and withdrawal methods increases the complexity of the scenarios involved.

### Risks:

- Incorrect balance deduction
- Miscalculated fees
- Withdrawals processed without verification
- Inability to withdraw
- Problems with deposits increase user drop-offs

## 2. Games and Betting Logic

It is the core of the business. Failures here impact revenue, game trust, and can deter new users due to the platform's bad reputation.

### Risks:

- Incorrect payout of bets
- Duplicate or unregistered bets
- UI not reflecting results
- Difficult usability
- Lack of clarity in game rules

## 3. Affiliate Program

The affiliate program is responsible for bringing new users and increasing revenue. Any failure here affects acquisition, commission tracking, and the trust of affiliates in the platform.

### Risks:

- Affiliate links not tracking registrations
- Commissions calculated incorrectly
- Affiliates blocked without reason or notification

## 4. Redeem and Credit Conversion

This functionality ensures that users can redeem promotions or gift codes. This benefits user retention, and any error here can reduce credibility and discourage continued platform use. Problems in this area may also cause financial losses if rules are not properly applied.

### Risks:

- Credits deducted but not delivered
- Redemption allowed outside the rules
- Inconsistent transaction history

## 5. Security, Compliance, and Fraud Prevention

Protects users, the company, and ensures legal compliance (KYC/AML, responsible gaming). Since we handle customer and financial data, security is always critical to guarantee data integrity and protect against hackers/fraudsters.

### Risks:

- Undetected fraud
- Users from prohibited jurisdictions playing
- Ignored betting limits
- Sensitive data being accessed
